PowerShell is a scripting language and shell built on top of the .NET framework.

PowerShell provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the operating system, 
as well as a scripting language for writing scripts to automate common tasks.

One of the key features of PowerShell is its ability to work with .NET objects and APIs, 
which makes it a powerful tool for managing Windows systems.
